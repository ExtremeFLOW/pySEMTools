# pySEMTools
A package for post-processing data obtained using a spectral-element method (SEM), on hexahedral high-order elements.

Documentation is available [here](https://extremeflow.github.io/pySEMTools/).

There is a paper available (link to Arxiv updated soon). In case you find the tools useful, please cite as (updated soon). The work was partially funded by the “Adaptive multi-tier intelligent data manager for Exascale (ADMIRE)” project,
which is funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 JTI-EuroHPC research and innovation program under grant
Agreement number: 956748. 

# Installation

To install in your pip enviroment, clone this repository and execute:
```
pip install  --editable .
```

The `--editable` flag is optional, and will allow changes in the code of the package to be used
directly without reinstalling.

## Dependencies

### Mandatory

You can install dependencies as follow:

```
pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install pymech
pip install tdqm
```
#### mpi4py
`mpi4py` is needed even when running in serial, as the library is built with communication in mind. It can typically be installed with: 
```
pip install mpi4py
```

In some instances, such as in supercomputers, it is typically necesary that the mpi of the system is used. If `mpi4py` is not available as a module, we have found (so far) that installing it as follows works:
```
export MPICC=$(which CC)
pip install mpi4py --no-cache-dir
```
where CC should be replaced by the correct C wrappers of the system (In a workstation you would probably need mpicc or so). It is always a good idea to contact support or check the specific documentation if things do not work.

### Optional

#### ADIOS2

Some functionalities such as data streaming require the use of adios2. You can check how the installation is performed [here](https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setting_up/setting_up.html)

#### PyTorch

Specifically for the interpolator routines, a pytorch module is available in case you have GPUs and want to use them in the process. We note that we only use pytorch in this one instance as an option. There are versions that work exclusively with numpy on CPUs so pytorch can be avoided.

To install pytorch, you can check [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). A simple installation for CUDA v12.1 on linux would look like this (following the instructions from the link):
```
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```
The process of installing pytorch in supercomputers is more intricate. In this case it is best to use the documentation of the specific cluster or contact support.


# Use

To get an idea on how the codes are used, feel free to check the examples we have provided. Please note that most of the routines included here work in prallalel. In fact, python scripts are encouraged rather than notebooks to take advantage of this capability.

# Tests

You can use the provided tests to check if your installation is complete (Not all functionallities are currently tested but more to come).

The tests rely on `pytest`. To install it in your pip enviroment simply execute `pip install pytest`. To run the tests, execute the `pytest tests/` command from the root directory of the repository.
