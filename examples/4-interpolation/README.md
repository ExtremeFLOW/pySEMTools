# Interpolation

In these examples we show the interpolation alternatives we have.

1. Interpolation to general query points
2. Interpolation keeping the element structure: prefinement, mapping to new distributions
3. Interpolating with 2D sem meshes
4. Interpolating a case where the input points are also distributed
5. How to generate a structured mesh with mass matrix that can be used for POD and such.
6. Interpolating file sequences with our helper functions
7. How to visualize point-clouds in 3D directly in python.
8. How to mirror fields for treating symmetries for POD.
