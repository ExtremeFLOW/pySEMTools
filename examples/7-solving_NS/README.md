# Solving equations

Since pysemtools allows to perform direct-stiffness sumation and derivatives using the SEM formulation, it is relatively simple to use it to solve equations as well.

In this folder, you can see an example of using pysemtools to attack a toy problem. This is not the most practical thing, but it could be used for prototyping or educational purposes.
