# Statistics

In these examples we show how to use the functionalities of pysemtools to post process statistics.

1. Post processing mean fields from a nek type simulation.
4. Get turbulent kinetic energy budgets from a pre-computed file with all relevant statistics.
5. Spatial averaging cases with one clear homogenous direction. Mapping from 3D to 2D files.
6. How to, from an intial set of snapshots, produce augmented data that can be used to calculate high-order statistics, as in example 4.
