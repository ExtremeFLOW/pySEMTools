# Examples

Here you can explore some of the available functionalities of this package.

The examples are divided into multiple folders. The core functionalities are in the following ones:

1. Shows general interaction with data types and how to write data and subdivide domains.
2. Shows how to communicate data between ranks easily using the wrapper classes of the module
3. Shows how to perfom operations on the sem mesh.
4. How some of the interpolation options available in the module 
5. Reduced order modelling (through Proper orthogonal decomposition)

We also provide some examples on a typical post-processing task when studying turbulence: Statistics. 
The examples related to this are in folder: 
6. Statistics

Since pysemtools provides many functionalities, we show how you could build a solver for NS in:
7. Solving_NS

It is more precise to say: integrating_NS, though :)

The examples in folders 1 to 6 are run as part of the intergration tests and should remain usable as the versions progress.
